=head1 NAME

App::JobLog::Command - common functionality of App::JobLog commands

=head1 VERSION

version 1.028

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<App::JobLog::Command> adds a small amount of specialization and functionality to L<App::Cmd> commands. In
particular it adds a C<--help> option to every command and ensures that they all have some minimal longer
form description that can be obtained with the C<help> command.
