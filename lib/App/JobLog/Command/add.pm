Log an event. E.g.,

  @{[prog_name($0)]} @{[__PACKAGE__->name]} munging the widget

All arguments that are not parameter values are concatenated as a description
of the event. Logging an event simultaneously marks the end of the previous
event. Events may be tagged to mark such things as client, grant, or 
project.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<App::JobLog::Command::add> is the command you'll use most often. It appends an event to the log.

=head2 TAGS

You may optionally attach categories to tasks with tags. Any string can be a tag but to make the output readable you'll want them
to be short. Also, in the logs tags are delimited by whitespace and separated from the timestamp and description by colons, so
these characters will be escaped with a slash. If you edit the log by hand and forget to escape these characters the log will
still parse but you will be surprised by the summaries you get.

You may specify multiple tags, but each one needs its own B<--tag> flag.

If you don't specify otherwise the new event will inherit the tags of the previous event, so you will need to apply
the B<--clear-tags> option to prevent this. The reasoning behind this feature is that you change tags seldom but change tasks
often so inheriting tags by default saves labor.
