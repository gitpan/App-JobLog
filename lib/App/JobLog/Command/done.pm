=head1 NAME

App::JobLog::Command::done - close last open event

=head1 VERSION

version 1.009

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 houghton@NorthernSpy:~$ job done
 houghton@NorthernSpy:~$ 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When you invoke L<App::JobLog::Command::add> to append a new event to the log this moment
also marks the end of any previous event. If an event is ongoing and you simply wish to mark its
end -- if you're signing off for the day, for example -- use B<App::JobLog::Command::done>.
