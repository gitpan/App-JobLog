If you are getting strange results with @{[App::JobLog::Command::summary->name]}, the problem
might be the time expression you're using. This command lets you see how your expression is
getting parsed.

It repeats to you the phrase it has parsed, prints out the start and end time of the corresponding
interval, and finally, whether it understands itself to have received an expression of the form
<date> or <date> <separator> <date>, the latter form being called an "interval" for diagnostic
purposes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you are getting strange results with summary, the problem
might be the time expression you're using. This command lets you see how your expression is
getting parsed.

It repeats to you the phrase it has parsed, prints out the start and end time of the corresponding
interval, and finally, whether it understands itself to have received an expression of the form
<date> or <date> <separator> <date>, the latter form being called an "interval" for diagnostic
purposes.
