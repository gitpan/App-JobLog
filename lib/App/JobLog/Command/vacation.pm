=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<App::JobLog::Command::vacation> allows you to include time off in your summaries of work events. In most cases time off --
holidays, vacation, sick days, etc. -- are a completely different entity from work log events. They are the equivalent of
a number of hours of work but these hours don't have a defined start or end, they may repeat at predictable intervals, and
in some cases their duration is flexible, stretching or shrinking depending on how much actual time you work in the day. On
the other hand, sometimes you want to report time off just as you do a regular event, giving it a fixed start and end time
and hence duration. Because of the peculiar nature of time off, and because it can overlap regular events in ill-defined
ways, vacation time is stored in its own file, F<.joblog/vacation>. This is the least human readable of the files used by
L<App::JobLog>, but still it isn't too bad:

 houghton@NorthernSpy:~$ cat ~/.joblog/vacation 
 2011  2 15  0  0  0:2011  2 15 23 59 59:02::Ides
 2011  2 13  0  0  0:2011  2 15 23 59 59:01::Lupercalia
 2011  3  7  0  0  0:2011  3  7 23 59 59:10::job day

If you wish to understand this format you can look at the code for L<App::JobLog::Vacation::Period>, but in general you
should use B<App::JobLog::Command::vacation> to modify this file.

=head2 CATEGORIES OF TIME OFF

=over 8

=item repetition

Most time off occurs in a fixed interval of a fixed year. All time off is representable this way. For convenience, though,
one may also specify that a period repeats annually or monthly.

=item flexibility

Most intervals of time off give you the expected number of work hours per day that would otherwise be a work day. One may
also mark a vacation period as fixed or flexible, however. A fixed period behaves in every way like a work event except
it doesn't appear in the work log. A flexible vacation period shrinks or expands as needed to fill out the hours to the
full complement in the days in which they occur.

=back

=head2 SORT ORDER

When sorted among themselves, monthly intervals sort before annual which sort before fixed. Ordinary events sort before
all vacation events except fixed time off, which sorts as an ordinary event.
