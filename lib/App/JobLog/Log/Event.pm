=head1 NAME

App::JobLog::Log::Event - basically adds an end time to App::JobLog::Log::Line events

=head1 VERSION

version 1.025

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<App::JobLog::Log::Event> represents an interval in time from the log, providing accessors
to all the information about this event. It is similar to L<App::JobLog::Log::Line>, delegating
to an instance of the latter for much functionality, but it contains additional methods to
handle the properties of intervals of time as distinct from points.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 clone

Create a duplicate of this event.

=head2 overlap

Expects two L<DateTime> objects as arguments. Returns the portion of this event
overlapping the interval so defined.

=head2 end

End of event. Is lvalue method.

=head2 cmp

Used to sort events. E.g.,

 my @sorted_events = sort { $a->cmp($b) } @unsorted;

=head2 is_closed

Whether an end moment for this event is defined.

=head2 is_open

Whether no end moment for this event is defined.

=head2 duration

Duration of event in seconds.

=head2 split_days

Splits a multi-day event up at the day boundaries.

=head2 intersects

Whether the time period of this overlaps with another.
